BUGFIX: Fixed two issues in Ticket #5:
Issue 1) Import debuff doesn't work if there are currently no detected debuffs
for that zone.
Issue 2) Under some conditions the detected debuffs were being placed in the wrong zone, usually the zone you were joining the instance from.

Prior to this version the detected debuffs would show debuffs and buffs
applied from outside the raid to raid members.  The icon would only show
debuffs, so there is no reason for this addon to detect buffs from outside the raid. Now only debuffs are added to the detected list.
