--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- cleanup
Infus:
	- Fix cooldown not showing if show was triggerd by a secondary trigger
	This seems to be caused by OmniCC. That is I can't reproduce the bug
	without OmniCC enabled. Poking around OmniCC didn't produce any clue
	on why it is buggy. Calling SetCooldown immediately prior to calling
	show does though, fix the bug without apparently breaking the non
	OmniCC case.
	
	Ticket: 210
Mirrormn:
	- Fixed a bug that would cause the WeakAurasOptions window to get stuck forever in a "minimized" mode under some circumstances.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- let the cache overwrite name<>icon mappings when there is a newer (higher id) icon for an old spell.
Infus:
	- Fix talent multi selection
	The code trying to upgrade use_talent ensured that it was always true or
	nil. That's actually not required and prevented the false state, which
	is multi selection.
Stew:
	- yOffset still bugged for invisible auras
Infus:
	- Check if pet is alive for "Pet Active" trigger
	After a pet dies UnitExists("pet") still returns true until the
	pet vanishes. That's unlikely to be what anyone actually wants
	out of that trigger.
	- Fix ignore rune cd interaction with inverse
	- Aurabar: Fix modify to correctly apply text/timer font changes
Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Fix type check
	- Stop leaking "trigger" variable
Benjamin Staneck:
	- whitespace commit to get the packager going
	- Changes SetTexCoord calls to work with Masque skins that do SetTexCoord calls themselves.
	With this patch, WeakAuras' SetTexCoord calls use the Masque's skinned values as base values, which are then modified for the Zoom levels set in the WeakAuras options.
brawne:
	- make sure ItemEquip auras untrigger when item is unequipped
Infus:
	- Add misssing Blizzard Textures
	Also rename the group from Catacylsm Alerts to Blizzard Alerts,
	which is more accurate.
Timmeh:
	- Replace commented ButtonFacade support with working Masque support.
Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add replacement functions for ActionButton_(Show|Hide)OverlayGlow to avoid taint caused by using them.
	- Add a mechanism to override functions for scripts
Infus:
	- Fix renaming auras
	- Aurabar: Fix vertical progress bars to not shrink, but crop textures
	Ticket-Number: 169
	- Pet battles: Actually listen to the events
	Ticket-Number: 107
	- DK: Fix ignore rune cd
